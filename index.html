            <h2>Types of shaders</h2>
            <p>There are many different types of shaders, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vertex shaders: These shaders operate on each individual vertex of a 3D model.</li>
                <li>Pixel shaders: These shaders operate on each individual pixel of a 2D image or 3D scene.</li>
                <li>Geometry shaders: These shaders operate on entire shapes or groups of vertices.</li>
                <li>Compute shaders: These shaders operate on large sets of data and can be used for general-purpose computing on the GPU.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Example of a shader program</h2>
            <p>Here's an example of a simple shader program:</p>
            <pre><code>
                #version 330 core

                void main() {
                    gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.5, 0.31, 1.0);
                }
            </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>in this specific shader we state the version and color the output so it's basically coloring with a color #ff7523</p>
        </section>

            <h2>What is a shader?</h2>
            <p>
                A Shader is computation of a math equations with different variables in which the result is a 4 digit vector (x,y,z,w) with the first numbers being numbers representing the color of a pixel <b>rgb</b> and the w represents the alpha of the same pixel, this values are managed in a hexadecimal value so that the minimum value is 00 and the max is ff. You may recognize this format from inputting #ffffff well if you don't already know these values represent rgb of something. So for a purple(red + blue)-half-transparent pixel you would get ff 00 ff 7E.
            </p>
            <h2>The basics</h2>
            <p>
                Now for shaders you usually get a function with more than 4 variables and some constants normally you would get a the coordinate of a pixel the problem is different screens with different resolutions get different coordinates for the last pixel say (720,720) or (1980,1080) soâ€¦ what to do? As default there is a term we called UV which is represented by the formula f(x,y) = fragCoord.xy / Resolution.xy wich for any point of any screen gives a normalized vector with max (1,1) and minimum (0,0) if we pass that directly to the vector 4 output you get this image (red = x coordinates and y = green)
            </p>
            <div class="container">
                <img src="uvmap.png">
                <p>So as we can see the 0,0 coordinates are on the bottom left corner and 1,1 is on the top rigth just as anyone would expect. Now with these coordinates we can finally create shaders. I will first explain the mathematical equation for each shader and then the actual conversion to shaders what i will not explain though is the conversion from maths to code because it is easy no reason and for big shaders it is fun to do.</p>
